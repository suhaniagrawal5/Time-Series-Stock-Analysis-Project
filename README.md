Stock Market Analysis & Visualization

📌 Project Overview:
This project focuses on the analysis and description of stock market data to understand price movements, trends, and patterns over time.
The project combines data analysis in Python with an interactive Streamlit web application, allowing users to explore stock data dynamically.
The main goal of this project is to transform raw stock data into meaningful insights and interactive visualizations.

1. Objectives:
Perform descriptive analysis of stock price data
Identify trends and patterns in stock performance
Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit
Enable users to explore stock data visually

2. Project Workflow:
Data Collection & Loading:
Loaded historical stock data into Python
Checked data structure, types, and completeness

3. Data Cleaning & Preparation:
Handled missing values
Converted date columns to proper datetime format
Prepared data for time-series analysis

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Calculated descriptive statistics (mean, median, volatility)
Analyzed price trends over time
Compared stock performance using visualizations

5. Streamlit Dashboard:
Built an interactive web app using Streamlit
Added filters for stock selection and date ranges
Displayed dynamic charts and summary metrics

6. Visualizations & Features:
Interactive line charts for stock prices
Summary statistics panels
Trend and comparison visualizations
User-controlled filters for exploration

7. Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, I learned:
How to analyze financial time-series data
Importance of descriptive statistics in stock analysis
Building interactive dashboards using Streamlit

8. How to Run the App?
   
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  streamlit run app.py

This project strengthened my skills in data analysis, visualization, and Python-based web apps.
